# Ball-Point-Game

*Attention: this project is only available in German!*

The Ball-Point-Game is a warm-up game to get to know agile working.eee

### Material: 
- At least 30 balls
- One NAO robot
- 3-200 players

### How it works
The game consists of 3 rounds (adjustable in the counter). Each round consists of 2 minutes of planning, 2 minutes of execution and 1 minute of retrospective. 
In planning, the participants first have to estimate how many balls they will bring into the goal. Afterwards, they discuss in the planning how they want to achieve this task. Then the game starts and the participants have to throw the balls to each other and bring them into the goal. In the retrospective, the participants say what went well and reflect on their actions. In each subsequent round, the group tries to improve.
