# "Ball-Point-Game" for NAO robot [v1.1]

*Attention: this project is only available in German!*

### About

The Ball-Point-Game is a warm-up game to get to know agile working. <br>

### How the program works

The game consists of 3 rounds (adjustable in the counter). Each round consists of 2 minutes of <br>
planning, 2 minutes of execution and 1 minute of retrospective. In planning, the participants <br>
first have to estimate how many balls they will bring into the goal. Afterwards, they discuss in <br>
the planning how they want to achieve this task. Then the game starts and the participants have to <br>
throw the balls to each other and bring them into the goal. In the retrospective, the participants <br>
say what went well and reflect on their actions. In each subsequent round, the group tries to improve.

### What do you need?

- At least 30 balls
- One NAO robot
- 3-200 players

### Plans of further development:

We currently have no plans to further develop the program.
